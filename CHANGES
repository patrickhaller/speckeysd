Change Log for "speckeysd"

2006-10-12	elliotth	San Jose

	Various fixes suggested by Tuncer Ayaz, Adam Sampson, and Anselm R. Garbe:

	* Fix build by adding missing #includes for waitpid(2).

	* Follow advice on execl(3) man page of casting sentinel to (char*); GCC catches this error.

	* Wait for children as they die, rather than next time we start a child.

	* Remove useless header file.

	* Add error reporting if we fail to grab a key.

	* Support Mod1, Mod2, Mod3, Mod4, and the alternative names "Alt" and "Super".

	* Use XKeycodeToKeysym instead of XLookupString to work better with non-US keyboards.
